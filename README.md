 # About me
I am a Master's student in computer science at the University of Sciences and Techniques Houari Boumedien Bab Ezzouar. During my studies, I was able to acquire a solid base in various fields related to computer science (algorithms, databases, object-oriented paradigm, networks) as well as knowledge in mathematics (calculations, linear algebra, statistics and probabilities ). My end-of-studies project with a research team from our university and in collaboration with a laboratory from the University of Michigan at Dearborn was a great opportunity for me to apply what I learned during the course and to to acquire more and more knowledge on advanced subjects. topics in AI, web semantics, web services and machine learning. I am now looking to develop and use my computer skills, especially in machine learning and deep learning applications.
